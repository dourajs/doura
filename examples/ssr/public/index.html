      %BASE_HREF% is a placeholder, that is supposed to be replaced by the
      server-side renderer. %BASE_HREF% is determined during runtime and can be
      changed without recompiling making your compiled web app independent of
      a server / CDN location. The base tag specifies how to resolve relative
      URLs for CSS files, favicon, etc (notice the trailing slash in the href
      attribute). Therefore, using %BASE_HREF% only makes sense if all other URL
      references are kept relative. Alternatively, you can delete the base tag
      and use %PUBLIC_URL% as documented by create-react-app.
